A security steganography scheme based on hdr image -- https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10943


Definitions:

DCT - discrete cosine transform : technique used in signal processing and data compression. 
    Used in : 
        Digital imaging: Jpeg & HEIF
        Digital Video: MPEG & H.26x
        Digital Audio: Dolby Digital, MP3, AAC
        Digital Television: SDTV, HDTV, VOD
        Digital Radio: AAC+, DAB+
        Speech Coding: AAC-LD, Siren, Opus

    It's a Fourier-related transform
    Summary: Apprently the DTC is better because it uses cosine instead of sine functions, cosine requiring fewer equations to approximate a signal, 
    also "differential equations the cosines express a particular choice of boundary conditions" -whatever this means.

Bayesian optimization - it's used to determine a black box function's optimal parameters, assume the function's behaviour in a PRIOR. 
                        then it gathers the data from the evaluation, and updates it with this data to the POSTERIOR which then this creates the next query point.
Generative adversarial networks (GANs)- two machines fight each other in a game to get better




Black-Box Watermarking for Generative Adversarial Networks - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.08457.pdf
    
    They use Machine Learning to let the computers learn how to embed watermark into photos and then the other party tries to break it(?). 


STEGANOGRAPHY GAN: CRACKING STEGANOGRAPHY WITH CYCLE GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04008.pdf

    From my understanding, they use GANS and the Bayesian optimization to "crack" (??) the least significant bit (LSB) encoded by "Convolutional Autoencoders"
