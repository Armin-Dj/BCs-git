DCT - discrete cosine transform : technique used in signal processing and data compression. 
    Used in : 
        Digital imaging: Jpeg & HEIF
        Digital Video: MPEG & H.26x
        Digital Audio: Dolby Digital, MP3, AAC
        Digital Television: SDTV, HDTV, VOD
        Digital Radio: AAC+, DAB+
        Speech Coding: AAC-LD, Siren, Opus

    It's a Fourier-related transform
    Summary: Apprently the DTC is better because it uses cosine instead of sine functions, cosine requiring fewer equations to approximate a signal, 
    also "differential equations the cosines express a particular choice of boundary conditions" -whatever this means.

Bayesian optimization - it's used to determine a black box function's optimal parameters, assume the function's behaviour in a PRIOR. 
                        then it gathers the data from the evaluation, and updates it with this data to the POSTERIOR which then this creates the next query point.
Generative adversarial networks (GANs)- two machines fight each other in a game to get better

Zeckendorf's theorem - any positive integer can be written as a sum of any two non consecutive fibonacci numbers 
LZW - Lempel–Ziv–Welch - Compression algorithm, universal lossless data compression algorithm, used by many applications GIF, TIFF, PostScript, PDF, Unix Compress.

1. Black-Box Watermarking for Generative Adversarial Networks - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.08457.pdf
    
    They use Machine Learning to let the computers learn how to embed watermark into photos and then the other party tries to break it(?).

3. STEGANOGRAPHY GAN: CRACKING STEGANOGRAPHY WITH CYCLE GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04008.pdf

    From my understanding, they use GANS and the Bayesian optimization to "crack" (??) the least significant bit (LSB) encoded by "Convolutional Autoencoders"

4. Two high capacity text steganography schemes based on color coding - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00948.pdf

    Uses two methods: Permutation and numeration systems.
    
    They have the following: 
        A secret message which they want to encode.
        A dummy message in which the code will be encrypted(stega'd) into.
        A color pattern which will serve as the encryption/stega pattern to hide the secret message into the dummy message.

    They call the final product "THE STEGO-TEXT"
    They send the stego text by email 

5. Efficient High Capacity Steganography Technique - https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2004/2004.11984.pdf

    They proposed to take the limit from Zeckendorf's theorem for embedding and their embedded capacity extended to almost double when compared to fibonacci methods. 
    It is also secure against RS, POV and DIH.

6. Steganography Based on Pixel Intensity Value Decomposition - https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2004/2004.11977.pdf

    They are using a method based on 16 virtual bit-planes, the sum of all bit-planes does not exceed the 255 pixel intensity limit. This method has a better payload capacity/stego quality
than other decomposition methods (doesn't say which).
